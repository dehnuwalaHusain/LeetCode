## Solution Approach
My strategy for tackling LeetCode problems centers around a methodical approach aimed at delivering accurate and efficient solutions. I kickstart the process by meticulously understanding the problem, followed by a pen-and-paper exploration to visualize potential solution paths. With a clear plan in mind, I translate my insights into a preliminary code draft, rigorously testing its validity across various scenarios. Once satisfied with its correctness, I shift focus towards optimizing time and space complexity through iterative refinement. This ensures that my solutions are not only correct but also optimized for efficiency.
